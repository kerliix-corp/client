- Include relevant **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **visual regression testing** if applicable.

_Optional body explaining what and why._

## Branching Strategy

We follow a strict branching model:

- `main` — Production-ready code (auto-deployed)
- `develop` — Staging integration branch
- `feature/*` — New features (branch from `develop`)
- `bugfix/*` — Bug fixes (branch from `develop`)
- `hotfix/*` — Critical production fixes (branch from `main`, then merged back)

> ⚠️ **Never commit directly to `main` or `live`.** All changes must be made through branches and pull requests.
